# Burn Plan Determination App

* This is a temp. description.
The Burn Plan Determination app connects to OpenWeather and takes in user information. It then determines if a burn can proceed. (Something like that)

Project Status: **incomplete, not tested, no test failures, and no known bugs**

## Dependencies

The burn plan determination app depends on [the OpenWeather REST connector](**Link for OpenWeather Git**).
The REST connector must be in the project's build path during development (and the project's classpath?) when the app is run.

For development, JUnit 4 is required to run the project's unit tests.
