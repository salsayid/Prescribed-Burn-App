# Burn Plan Evaluation App

* This is a temp. description.
The Burn Plan Evaluation app connects to OpenWeather and takes in user information. It then determines if a burn can proceed. (Something like that)

Project Status: **incomplete, not tested, no test failures, and no known bugs**

Authors:
*	Brett Johnson <bjohnson261@unl.edu>
*	Sayid Alsayid <salsayid2@unl.edu>
*	Rachael Solberg <rsolberg3@unl.edu>
*	Ethan Friedman <efriedman4@unl.edu>
*	Delanie Miller <dmiller77@unl.edu>
*	Connor Fausett <cfausett2@unl.edu>

## Dependencies

The burn plan evaluation app depends on [the OpenWeather REST connector](**Link for OpenWeather Git**).
The REST connector must be in the project's build path during development (and the project's classpath?) when the app is run.

For development, JUnit 4 is required to run the project's unit tests.

## Building

[Building Info Goes Here]

## Running

For development, 'BurnPlanEvaluationAlgorithm.java' can be run in Eclipse by right-clicking on it in the "Package Explorer" and selecting "Run As" â†’ "Java Application".
